Hi I'm Ali. 

A developer behind uncountable no. of graphical softwares written for windows platform, each one adding its own value.

Almost all of them are private, serving commercial sector. But I will try to open source at [@EasingSoft](https://www.github.com/EasingSoft), which might be useful for public view.
